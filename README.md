I found that sales growth in the central region of the USA is high in the office appliance category during the month of December.


Why sales rate is higher in the central region  in office Appliances as compared to other regions of the USA?

Economic Factors: Central states may have a stronger and more diversified economy with a higher concentration of businesses, corporations, and industries that require office appliances. This can lead to increased demand for office equipment and appliances.

Business Density: Central states often have a higher density of businesses, including corporate offices, government agencies, and educational institutions. These entities typically require a range of office appliances, such as computers, printers, copiers, and furniture, leading to higher sales.

Population and Urbanization: Central states may have larger and more densely populated cities, which are hubs for commercial activity and businesses. Urban areas have a higher demand for office appliances due to the concentration of offices and commercial establishments.

Why is the sales rate particularly increasing in the month of December?

Year-End Budget Spending: Many businesses and organizations operate on a fiscal year that ends in December. To fully utilize their budgets and take advantage of potential tax benefits, they may make significant purchases, including office appliances, before the year concludes.

Holiday Shopping Season: December is associated with the holiday shopping season, which includes both consumer and business purchases. Businesses may take advantage of holiday discounts and promotions to upgrade their office equipment during this time.



I have just written down all the possible outcomes from my analysis.
